<- Vector ---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles vectors.

An instance is constructed from  a destination Vertex 'dest', and an optional
origin Vertex 'orig'.
If no origin is provided, it is assumed to be a Vertex with x, y and z as 0 and
w as 1.

ex :
$dest = new Vertex ( array( 'x' => 1.0, 'y' => 1.0, 'z' => 1.0, 'w' => 1.0 ) );
$orig = new Vertex ( array( 'x' => 0.0, 'y' => 0.0, 'z' => 0.0, 'w' => 1.0 ) );

Any other use is undefined behaviour.

The class provides the following accessors :
getX(), getY(), getZ(), getW()

The class provides the following methods :

float magnitude();
Returns the length (or "norm") of the Vector.

Vector normalize();
Returns the normalized vector. If the vector is already normalized, retruns a
fresh copy of the Vector.

Vector add( Vector $rhs );
Returns th Vector resulting from the sum of the Vectors.

Vector sub( Vector $rhs );
Returns the Vector resulting from the difference between the two Vectos.

Vector opposite();
Returs the opposite Vector;

Vector scalarProduct( $k );
Returns the product of the Vector with a scalar.
																			 
float dotProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returns the scalar product of the two Vectors.

float cos( Vector $rhs );
Returns the cosine of the angle between two Vectors.

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returns the cross product of the two Vectors in a right hand model.
